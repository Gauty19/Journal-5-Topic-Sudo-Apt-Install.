# Journal-5-Topic-Sudo-Apt-Install.
This is about the working on codings for the git.
In this class,we had also learnt about the git codings to make function git through the codings in sudo apt.This was delivered by a new lecturer.He taught us even we can run commands on sudo apt for git.The steps that were followed were:
1)“sudo apt install git”
2)after installing starting giving commands→”git config—-global user.email”gautam.kumar23_ug@apu.edu.in.”
3)now give commands—>$git init my repo—>$cd myrepo
4)$rm-rf myrepo and then ls.
5)cd myrepo and then again ls.
6) git status
7)git add file0.txt
8)git status
9)git commit -m”my first fit commit”
10)gitk
11)git—version
12)pico file0.txt
13)pico file0.txt
14)git status 
These are the codes that he had delivered on that day.Although it did not worked on my laptop after running some codes properly in the beginning but it was meaningful to me because it was all about the working on git through the code language.It was running on the laptop  my classmate it was wonderfully working.It was an updated version to work on git.It was all about how to create a new repository through running the code like $git init myrepo and then $cd myrepo.We can also perform pushing and pulling of repositories through the codes without going directly to the git.
